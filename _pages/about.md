Research Interest
======
I am interested in statistical methodology for biomedical data analysis, with a particular emphasis on machine learning–driven approaches for pathology imaging data.

My current interests center on spatial statistics and topological data analysis as tools for modeling complex spatial structure in high-resolution histopathology images. I am particularly drawn to problems where classical statistical assumptions break down due to spatial dependence, heterogeneity, or high dimensionality.

While my training has so far focused on applying and adapting existing methods, I aim to move toward methodological and algorithmic development for interpretable analysis of biomedical imaging data.
